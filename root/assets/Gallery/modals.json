Your presence leaves persistent data points that serve as the primary language for interacting with a reactive AI. The environment evolves in real-time, non-linear dialogue between human movement and machine intelligence.",

      "description": "Abstract two-dimensional physically drawn watercolors and Neural Radiance Field technology were combined to create a connection from the first to the last artwork. The new technologies allowed us to visualize the experience of experiencing flat images as a whole.\n\nFor this project, we experimented to create our own pipeline to work with camera trajectories and train models. Initially, we were unsure of the end result. We cause a glitch and force the neural network to build something three-dimensional and real from something that is not.",

Realized in the form of a playground — a 'playroom' — in the given contest dimensions of 5x5 m.\n\n'If I can't see it, then it doesn't exist'. It is easy to ignore a process whose resulting impact cannot be seen or touched. Can we continue to turn our backs on the problems of algorithmic recognition if 'observation without an observer' is verbally articulated, remaining just as invisible and pervasive?",
